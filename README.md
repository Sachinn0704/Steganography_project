# Steganography_project
This Steganography Project is designed to conceal secret messages within digital media, primarily images, without raising suspicion. Steganography is the art of hiding information in plain sight, and this project demonstrates how data such as text or files can be embedded within image pixels that the modifications are visually undetectable.
